I was born and raised in Western New York(go Bills!). I completed my undergrad at SUNY Fredonia in Economics and Business Administration 
and I am currently working on my Masterâ€™s degree in Analytics at University of New Hampshire. Sports or financial analytics are the fields
I plan to go into once I graduate.
