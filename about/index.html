I was born and raised in Western New York(go Bills!). I completed my undergrad at SUNY Fredonia in Economics and Business Administration and I am currently working on my Masterâ€™s degree in Analytics at University of New Hampshire. Sports or financial analytics are the fields I plan to go into once I graduate. 
The reason I love data science because every aspect of it pisses me off. From the programming aspect, to the data cleaning and modeling, there is always a hiccup in every problem. But I love the journey every data science problem gives me, I always get frustrated and sometimes I put weeks into a problem and do not get the solution that I believe is adequate, but because of that I am always learning and that is what makes the journey always worth it. No two datasets or problems are every alike. But that is what makes data science the best career foe me because it is never stall or dry, there is always new models to try and new techniques to use.
