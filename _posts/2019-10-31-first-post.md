Here it is, my first blog post, Happy Halloween!
Over the past week, I have been working on web scraping the U-Haul website. I have posted the code and project here(link). 
The reaosn I wanted to scrape U-Haul is because of a video I watched a couple years ago that showed that there are huge 
differences in prices for example going from Chiago to Dallas verses going the reverse direction.
